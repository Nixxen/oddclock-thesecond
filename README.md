# OddClock:TheSecond
Oddclock is a simple 24 hour digital alarm clock that allows custom alarm sounds.

## Disclaimer:
This is a re-upload of one of my old google code repositories. Google code repos were taken offline in the mid 2010s and I feel it would be a shame to let the repo disappear completely to the void of the internet. The clock was originally written back in 2010 or so, and updated whenever I saw fit. In other words, this is not a recent repo, and any updates are (probably) not going to happen. The source code is there if you have an old enough version of GM.

## Original readme:
Currently the project is in beta.

Download. Unzip to wherever you want it, but make sure you have write access to the area. Launch. Everything is pretty well explained in the clock interface(I mean.. it's a clock.. How hard can it be:P).

Tested on Windows 7, Windows Vista and XP.

17th January 2012:

This project is developed as I see the need to change things in the clock. Should there be any interest in new features please contact me. The past year or so have had some changes whenever I found the need to make them, but I have not yet released the build since there are still issues to resolve. The next build will probably have most of these changes implemented either as a prototype or a finished feature. There is no timeline for the next release since there haven't been much activity around the project(at least not that I have noticed). If anyone want me to keep this project active(more than I currently have at least), please leave me an email/comment and I'll see what I can cook up.
